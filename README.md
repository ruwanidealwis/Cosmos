# Space Barcode

Generates a personalized barcode based on the date user enters.

## Motvation
I had always been fascinated by Space and wanted to learn more about it while also create a fun, lightweight app that can easily be used.

## Usage
The app is live at the link: https://spacebarcode.herokuapp.com
## What Does The App Do?
* Searches Nasa Databases for information about asteroids, solar flares, interplanetary shocks, geomagnetic storms and gets pictures captured on that day.
* Barcode is built using this data, with unique colours (based on pictures taken and event occured) and text (based on location of event)

## Data Sources
* Data is gathered from the Open NASA Api
* Hubble Telescope Data was gathered from: https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/hst_bday/data.csv

## Tools

* NodeJs/ExpressJs
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* JQuery
* AJAX

## Next Steps
* Incoperation of SpaceX flight data to the barcode
